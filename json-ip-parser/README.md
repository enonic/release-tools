# JSon IP Parser

This tool specifically takes as input, the .json file from Amazon, that lists IP adresses for their AWS cloud servers.  The list of possible regions is found on this page:
  http://support.loadimpact.com/knowledgebase/articles/174262-what-load-zones-and-ip-addresses-does-load-impact

The main method takes a variable size list of regions as input arguments and returns a valid XML config for Apache.
